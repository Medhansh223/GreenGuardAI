    ### Dataset
    - This dataset consists of various plant leaves affected by different diseases, aimed at training our model for accurate recognition.
    - It includes a wide range of plant types commonly found in gardens and farms, providing a comprehensive resource for developing disease-detection applications.

    ### Content
    - The dataset is organized into three main folders:
      1. **Train**: Contains 70295 images per disease category for training the model.
      2. **Test**: Contains 33 images for evaluating model performance.
      3. **Validation**: Contains 17572 images per category for fine-tuning and validation of model accuracy.
    - Each folder has subdirectories, except test, for each type of disease, ensuring a structured approach to model training.
